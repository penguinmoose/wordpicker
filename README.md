# Early Reading

The Early Reading page consists of tabs that have patterns on them, which are labeled by the category of the pattern. One additional tab is the custom tab, in which custom patterns that are not one of the presets can be searched.

## Custom search and the custom box

In the 'custom' tab, a custom pattern can be built 3 ways:

- Clicking the custom box and typing the pattern
- Dragging the custom icons from below the custom box into the custom box
- Clicking the custom icons from below the custom box to append the icon to the custom pattern

### Other buttons
- Pressing the button with the trash icon removes all custom icons from the custom box
- Pressing the find words button finds the inputed custom pattern

### Icon descriptions
- Open: Open vowel - input key is 'o'
- Closed: Closed vowel - input key is 'c'
- Vowel R: Vowel R (ar, er, ir, ur, or) - input key is 'r'
- Vowel Team: Vowel Team - input key is 't'
- Silent E: Silent E - input key is 'e'

- (Anything): Any quantity of any element between surrounding icons. If the anything icon is put at the beginning of the pattern, the word must end with the rest of the pattern, and vice versa for if the icon is put at the end. If the custom pattern is only an anything icon, all of the word list will be shown. - input key is '-'
